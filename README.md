## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I'm Gonzalo, a full-stack developer from Mar del Plata, Argentina.

- I'm currently living in CÃ³rdoba and pursuing an astronomy degree.
- I've been working as a developer for the last 4 years and I'm always looking forward for new learning opportunities.
- My main stack is javascript, featuring React.js and Node.js though I would love to learn Python and/or Go.
